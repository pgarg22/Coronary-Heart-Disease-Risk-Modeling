# Coronary Heart Disease Data Analysis

This repository contains data analysis and machine learning models applied to the **CHD (Coronary Heart Disease)** dataset.

## üìÅ Files

### 1. `ExploratoryDataAnalysis.py`
Performs preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the CHD dataset. Key operations include:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Converting categorical features into numerical ones
- Feature standardization
- Dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Visualization of principal components and variance

### 2. `ClassificationAndRegressionModels.py`
Trains and compares several machine learning models for predicting outcomes from the CHD dataset. Includes:
- Models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Model performance evaluation with cross-validation
- Statistical significance testing (dependent t-tests)
- Neural network training and visualization using PyTorch

### 3. `CHD.csv`
The dataset used for analysis and modeling. Contains medical and demographic variables related to coronary heart disease.

### 4. `Report-ExploratoryDataAnalysis.pdf`
This report corresponds to the initial phase of the project focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA), as implemented in ExploratoryDataAnalysis.py. The report covers a thorough investigation of a selected dataset, including data description, attribute characterization, missing value analysis, visualization (e.g., histograms, correlation plots, PCA), and an assessment of the dataset's suitability for future supervised learning tasks. It reflects the feature extraction and visualization and lays the foundation for the subsequent modeling phase.

### 4. `Report-ClassificationAndRegressionModels.pdf`
This report documents the supervised learning phase of the project based on ClassificationAndRegressionModels.py. It involves the development, evaluation, and comparison of classification and regression models (including regularized linear regression, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and baselines) using two-level cross-validation. The report includes statistical analysis of model performance and aims to determine the most effective predictive methods for the dataset, when using Supervised learning: Classification and regression.
